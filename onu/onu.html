            <h2>What is an ONU?</h2>
            <p>
                ONU (Optical Network Unit) is a device that connects end users to a passive optical network (PON). It receives data from the Optical Line Terminal (OLT) and converts optical signals into electrical signals for local use.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Receives optical signals from the OLT</li>
                <li>Converts optical signals into electrical signals</li>
                <li>Can be used with an external router for network distribution</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What is an ONT?</h2>
            <p>
                ONT (Optical Network Terminal) is a type of ONU that is specifically designed for end-user premises. It typically includes built-in routing and Wi-Fi functionalities, eliminating the need for an additional router.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Similar to an ONU but usually includes routing features</li>
                <li>Often used in Fiber-to-the-Home (FTTH) installations</li>
                <li>Directly connects to user devices like computers and smartphones</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Main Differences</h2>
            <p>
                While both ONU and ONT serve as interfaces between fiber-optic networks and user devices, ONT is a more integrated solution that often includes additional networking features.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>ONU:</strong> Requires an external router for full functionality</li>
                <li><strong>ONT:</strong> Typically includes built-in router and Wi-Fi</li>
                <li>ONT is usually placed inside homes, whereas ONU may be installed outdoors</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Where Are They Used?</h2>
            <p>
                ONU is often deployed in business environments or multi-dwelling units where multiple users share a connection. ONT, on the other hand, is commonly used in home fiber installations.

        <section class="column">
            <h2>How Do They Impact Internet Performance?</h2>
            <p>
                Both devices ensure high-speed internet access, but ONT may provide a more seamless experience due to integrated networking functions.
            </p>

        <section class="column">
            <h2>Fun Fact ðŸ’¡</h2>
            <p>
                The terms ONU and ONT are sometimes used interchangeably, but technically, all ONTs are ONUs, whereas not all ONUs are ONTs!
