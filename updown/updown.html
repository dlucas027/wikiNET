            <h2>What is Download?</h2>
            <p>
                Download is the process of receiving data from the internet to your device. It's what happens when you stream a video, open a website, or get an image sent to you â€” all of that content is being downloaded.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Receives data from the internet</li>
                <li>Used when watching videos, browsing, or opening files</li>
                <li>Usually faster than upload for most internet plans</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What is Upload?</h2>
            <p>
                Upload is the opposite of download â€” it's the process of sending data from your device to the internet. This happens when you send an email, post a photo, or join a video call.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sends data to the internet</li>
                <li>Used when sending files, live streaming, or using cloud services</li>
                <li>Essential for communication, backups, and remote work</li>

            <h2>Main Differences</h2>
            <p>
                While download refers to data coming **to you**, upload is about sending data **from you**. Internet plans often have much higher download speeds because most users consume more than they send.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Download:</strong> Receives data (e.g., streaming, browsing)</li>
                <li><strong>Upload:</strong> Sends data (e.g., sending emails, video calls)</li>
                <li>Download speed is usually higher than upload</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Why Is Upload Speed Important?</h2>
            <p>
                If you work remotely, play online games, or back up files to the cloud, upload speed is critical. Low upload speeds can cause delays in meetings, lag in games, and slow file transfers.

            <h2>How to Test Your Internet Speeds</h2>
            <p>
                You can test your download and upload speeds using tools like Speedtest.net or Fast.com. These tools measure how quickly data can be sent and received from your device.

            <h2>Fun Fact ðŸ’¡</h2>
            <p>
                The term "download" became popular with the rise of music and video sharing in the early 2000s. Meanwhile, "upload" gained relevance with the growth of social media and cloud storage.
