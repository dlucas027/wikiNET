# wikiNET🌎

## Welcome to wikiNET!

This project started at the first telecom company I worked for. We used to have regular internal training sessions, but there wasn’t a dedicated space to host the materials. Because of that, we ended up losing a lot of valuable content, and new employees often struggled to find those training resources.

**wikiNET** was born from that experience. Here, I’ve gathered basic networking knowledge for beginners.  
It’s important to note that the content here is different from the one used in the company — this is meant for the open-source community.  
The company's material remains private and contains internal links and proprietary information.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **CSS**: Used to style and animate components across the page, including layout, theming (like dark mode), and responsive adjustments for different screen sizes.

- **UX/UI**: The interface was designed with a clean and simple user experience in mind — from collapsible sidebars to smooth typing effects and dark mode toggling, everything aims to make navigation intuitive and pleasant.

- **JavaScript**: Powers the dynamic features such as the typing animation, theme toggle, sidebar behavior, and the chart rendering with interactivity and customization.

- **Responsiveness**: While the chart itself is set to a fixed size for better control, the overall layout adapts well to different devices. The theme switcher and interactive elements remain accessible across screen types.

## 📘 What I Learned

In this project, one of the key takeaways was learning how to create interactive charts using JavaScript, experimenting with modern libraries for data visualization. I also faced the challenge of implementing a functional sidebar menu on smaller devices — making sure navigation remained intuitive even on limited screen sizes.

Maintaining the clean and modern look I envisioned, while delivering a layout that feels like a real wiki, was both interesting and rewarding.

I also dove deeper into **media queries** to improve responsiveness, making sure the layout adapts smoothly to different screen resolutions without losing its aesthetic. Overall, it was a great hands-on experience in layout adaptation, usability, and UI/UX best practices for front-end projects.
