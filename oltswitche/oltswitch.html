            <h2>Main Differences</h2>
            <p>
                An **OLT (Optical Line Terminal)** is used in fiber-optic networks to distribute internet to multiple users, while a **switch** is used in local networks to connect devices within a LAN. Understanding their roles is crucial for network infrastructure.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>OLT:</strong> Manages and distributes fiber-optic internet (GPON, EPON)</li>
                <li><strong>Switch:</strong> Connects devices in a local network (LAN)</li>
                <li>Both are essential for stable and scalable networking</li>

            <h2>What is an OLT?</h2>
            <p>
                OLT (Optical Line Terminal) is a device used in fiber-optic networks to communicate with ONUs/ONTs. It controls the downstream and upstream data traffic and ensures efficient data transmission in FTTH (Fiber to the Home) systems.

            <h2>What is a Switch?</h2>
            <p>
                A switch is a networking device that connects multiple devices in a local area network (LAN). It forwards data packets based on MAC addresses, ensuring efficient communication between computers, printers, and other networked devices.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Used in homes, offices, and data centers</li>
                <li>Forwards data efficiently based on MAC addresses</li>
                <li>Can be managed or unmanaged</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Why Are OLTs Important?</h2>
            <p>
                OLTs are crucial for providing high-speed internet in fiber networks. They manage multiple users efficiently and ensure stable connections in GPON and EPON environments.

            <h2>How to Set Up a Switch?</h2>
            <p>
                Setting up a switch depends on the network type. Unmanaged switches work plug-and-play, while managed switches require VLANs, security configurations, and QoS settings.

            <h2>Fun Fact ðŸ’¡</h2>
            <p>
                The first Ethernet switch was created in 1990 by Kalpana, revolutionizing networking by allowing full-duplex communication and reducing network congestion.
